# CuboMath

CuboMath is an open-source Python mathematics library built as a playground for mathematical ideas.

It is a place where contributors can bring interesting math functions, clever shortcuts, elegant formulas, and creative approaches to problem solving — all implemented cleanly in Python.

CuboMath is not just about results. It is about how the math is done.

The project is designed around a simple idea:
math wizards write the spells, and math nerds learn and use them.

CuboMath welcomes:

Contributors who enjoy turning mathematical ideas into clean code

Students who want to understand math by reading real implementations

Developers who appreciate elegant formulas and smart shortcuts

Anyone who enjoys experimenting with “cool math stuff”

Rather than being a heavy or purely academic library, CuboMath focuses on:

Readable implementations

Clear mathematical intent

Educational value

Creative and interesting math techniques

Every function in CuboMath should feel like a small spell — concise, intentional,
and powerful — written to be understood, not just executed.

At its core, CuboMath is a collaborative space where mathematical creativity
meets open-source contribution.

## Installation

CuboMath can be installed using pip.

### Install from PyPI
