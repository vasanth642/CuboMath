#Fibonacci_finder

A Python utility for calculating Fibonacci numbers using Binet's closed-form expression.

## Description
This package provides a constant-time $O(1)$ approach to calculating the $n$-th Fibonacci number. By utilizing the Golden Ratio ($\phi$) instead of iterative loops or recursion, it offers a high-efficiency alternative for mathematical modeling.

## Installation
```bash
pip install Fibonacci_finder
